## Introduction
This tutorial aim to explain `dbparser` database functionalities to save the parsed drug information to a desired RDBM for the user benefit. To do that successfully user has to: 

* provide a working database connection information to either `open_db` function that uses DBI package or `open_mdb` function that uses MariaDB package.
* enable `save_table` option in parser functions.

Please note that this tutorial does not explain how to install these databases as it is out of the scope.

## Supported Databases
`dbparser` package uses two database packages `DBI` and `RMariaDB`.

`DBI` separates the connectivity to the DBMS into a *front-end* and a *back-end*. Applications use only the exposed front-end API. The back-end facilities that communicate with specific DBMSs (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MonetDB, etc.) are provided by drivers (other packages) that get invoked automatically through S4 methods.
For more information about DBI package please refer to [this link](https://db.rstudio.com/dbi/)

`RMariaDB` is much more simple and used to connect MariaDB.

The following are two examples of how to make the connection with *SQL Server* and *Maria DB*
### SQL Server

* Make sure you have a working connection to *SQL Server* instance

* Create new empty database to store drug information

* Provide this information to `open_db` function
```{r eval=FALSE}
open_db(
  driver = "SQL Server",
  server = "SQL2016", output_database = "drugbank"
)
```
* Enable `save_table` option in parser functions.
* Call `close_db` method after finishing from parsing to close your database connection properly.
 
### Maria Knowledge Base

* Install MariaDB
* Install MySQL client for MariaDB
* Do the same steps as SQL Server above.
