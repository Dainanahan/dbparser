## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Written package names, software names and API names in
single quotes (e.g. 'DrugBank') in Title and Description.

* Added an URL for 'DrugBank' in Description.

* Replaced `\dontrun{}` by `\donttest{}`.

## Test environments
* local x86_64-w64-mingw32, R 3.5.1
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.1

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

* This is the first release.
